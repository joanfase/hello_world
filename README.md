# hello_world
just another repository (tutorial)

Hi everyone!
My name is Joan. English is not my first language so forgive me if i've done any mispell.
I've done this repository as a try to better understand how Github works. I'm currently learning
Godot (and Gdscript) and Github is very helpul to manipulate files. Hope to have a great time here.

If you feel like it, leave a comment in the master branch.
See you guys later, bye!

Joan
